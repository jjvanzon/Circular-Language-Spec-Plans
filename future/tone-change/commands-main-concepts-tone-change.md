- [ ] ~ WAS AT: "Deeper Nested Command" rewording.
- [ ] ~ Might avoid saying same things multiple times using different words.
- [ ] ~ Word variation:
    - [ ] ~ Replacing some "may" and "might" occurrences with other words that introduce wiggle room.
- [ ] ~ Directness:
    - [ ] ~ Removing "might" and "may" where adequate wiggle room may already be present.
    - [ ] ~ Replacing indefinites back some with definites, for readability. 
    - [ ] ~ Reading over text again to reformulate for readability.
    - [ ] ~ Appropriateness:
        - [ ] ~ Definite language for comment on diagrams and syntax.
        - [ ] ~ Less definite language for philosophical opinion.
        - [ ] ~ Less definite language where ideas are iffy.

- [x] Fine-tune styling.
- [x] Evaluating if texts are in scope, possibly moving them.
    - [x] But most sections seem appropriate and in-scope to me, except maybe the bottom edge-cases, but I think I might get to that in time eventually.
    - [x] Commands Anywhere has a Broader View feel to it according to my opinion.
    - [x] I might actually move the section about In & Out to those terms are used: move them from the Commands chapter to the Parameters chapter.
- [x] Marking trigger words in red.
    - [x] With find and replace
    - [x] Manually
    - [x] Over-used words
        - [x] "The"
- [x] Finding replacement words, possibly using online thesaurus.
    - [x] Going through text sequentially.
    - [x] Sometimes moving things to an 'Out of Scope' section.
- [x] Change the orange markings (pictures, texts to move or change).
- [x]  Pictures:
    - [x] Maybe draw new ones in one go, on paper and then scan it.
    - [x] Sometimes borrow (pieces of) other pictures
    - [x] Or simplify pictures by editing them.
- [x] Merging conceptual/diagram explanations:
    - [x] When I reformulate things top to bottom, I might at one point feel that the merging of conceptual explanation and diagram explanation is actually finished, because right now, often they are put near each other, but not really became one merged text.
- [x] I have difficulty not wanting to change the story, while the aim is to just reword it, and I seem to experience an impossibility not absorbing the story. My conundrum might be solved, by adding indicators that everything is just a suggestion, so that no idea might disrupt anything, even when I may not entirely agree with it myself. Sometimes I might do the changes anyway.
- [x] I might go over the loose ideas in the document and cross out or distribute those.
- [x] Spell check.
