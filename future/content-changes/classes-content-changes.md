### TODO

- [ ] ~ Classes articles might need an update considering that the notation(s) for static might change things.
- [ ] ~ The readability of the Classes articles was questionable, which also might be a reason for updating it. They might be hard to follow.
- [ ] ~ In particular the explanations about Class Commands seems difficult.
- [ ] ~ Merging conceptual explanation and diagram notation explanation might be something to do.
- [ ] ~ The term Target Class might be split up in two definitions.

-----

- [ ] ~ The split up into a conceptual explanation and then separately an article for the diagram notation, might have been easy for writing the docs, but could be merged into a single article again for readability.

-----

- [ ] ~ The readability of these articles might be questioned. See 'Redo Easy Themes' in the document Encircle Language Spec Strategy.

### Done

- [x] Object-commands / command-objects exchangeability doubts.
- [x] It seems to be used as the main idea, this exchangeability. But that seems demotable to Encircle Broader View perhaps or maybe even Encircle Construct Drafts.
- [x] What might be left of the Classes story if the base of it might be deprecated? Almost a rewrite? Not sure.
- [x] What if I move the exchangeability issue to Encircle Broader View or Encircle Construct Drafts? Might not much text be left?
- [x] ~~Is there a version in the history that might not make the Object-commands / command-objects exchangeability issue centric? Could that text be used?~~
- [x] Some of the text seems to address the design time = run time issues. That issue might also not be in scope anymore.
- [x] I feel the same sentence is repeated a lot in just slightly different formulations.
- [x] Class Reference seems a bit of an ambiguous term. You might reference a class with an object line, but here I mean when an object points out its class with a class line. Class redirection? Class pointer? I think I might rather make pointer and reference synonymous, so maybe not class pointer.
- [x] The diagram explanation of Commands and Classes Loosely Coupled might be merged into the conceptual explanation, if I follow the editing ideas I had. But the issue might be moved from Encircle Language Spec to Encircle Broader View at some point, so perhaps this has less priority. Not sure. I could go either way.
