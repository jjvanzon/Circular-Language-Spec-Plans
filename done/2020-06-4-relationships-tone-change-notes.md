### Done

#### 2020-06-14 Done Checklist Reformulating Relationships Chapter

- [x] Marking standard trigger words in red, with search and replace, possibly marking questionable trigger words with a star (*) too.
- [x] ~~Manually marking trigger words in red:~~
    - [x] ~~Might not give high priority to marking trigger words manually anymore.~~
- [x] ~~Possibly manually mark questionable trigger words with a star (*) too.~~
- [x] ~~Finding replacement words, possibly using online thesaurus.~~
- [x] I have difficulty not wanting to change the story, while the aim is to just reword it, and I seem to experience an impossibility not absorbing the story. My conundrum might be solved, by adding indicators that everything is just a suggestion, so that no idea might disrupt anything, even when I may not entirely agree with it myself.

#### 2020-06-26 Done Reformulating Relationships Chapter

- [x] Redo trigger word analysis?
    - [x] I do think I see the pitfall of trigger words.
    - [x] Maybe do another trigger word analysis.
    - [x] I think I wanted to reconsider how I perform these trigger word analyses.
    - [x] Perhaps a standard list of words might be marked.
    - [x] I might want to reconsider the list of standard words, that I might mark with find and replace.
    - [x] Then manually spotting words of resoluteness.
    - [x] Replacing trigger words.
- [x] I do not seem to emphasize "bidirectional" much in the text of section "Bidirectional Relationships Between Objects". In "Bidirectional Relationships" from "1 to N Relationship" onward I also do not seem to mention the word "bidirectional" very much anymore. It might be welcome to repeat that every now and again, perhaps in each section have the word "bidirectional" in there at least once if it has anything to do with that.
- [x] Possible over-use of the word 'related'?
- [x] Read over top to bottom and made minor changes.
