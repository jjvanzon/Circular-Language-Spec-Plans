#### 2020-07-04 Done Checklist Reformulating Assignment Article

- [x] Fine-tune styling.
- [x] Evaluating if texts are in scope, possibly moving them.
    - [x] Moved pointer assignment topics to the Pointers chapter.
    - [x] Cross-Aspect Assignments still seems to have pointer-related parts.
- [x] Marking trigger words in red.
    - [x] With find and replace
    - [x] Manually
    - [x] Over-used words? "The"?
- [x] Finding replacement words, possibly using online thesaurus.
- [x] Putting subjectivity in perspective.
- [x] Change the orange markings (pictures, texts to move or change).
- [x] Pictures:
    - [x] Maybe draw new ones in one go, on paper and then scan it.
    - [x] Sometimes borrow (pieces of) other pictures
    - [x] Or simplify pictures by editing them.
- [x] Merge conceptual/diagram explanations:
    - [x] When I reformulate things top to bottom, I might at one point feel that the merging of conceptual explanation and diagram explanation is actually finished, because right now, often they are put near each other, but not really became one merged text.
- [x] I have difficulty not wanting to change the story, while the aim is to just reword it, and I seem to experience an impossibility not absorbing the story. My conundrum might be solved, by adding indicators that everything is just a suggestion, so that no idea might disrupt anything, even when I may not entirely agree with it myself. Sometimes I might do the changes anyway.
- [x] Going over the document again to reformulate.
- [x] Spell check.
