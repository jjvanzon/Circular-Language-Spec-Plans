### Done

#### 2020-06-07 Done Reformulating Objects Chapter

- [x] Marking trigger words in red.
- [x] Possibly mark questionable trigger words with a star (*) too.
- [x] Finding replacement words, possibly using online thesaurus.
    - [x] Changes to the 'Multiplicity' topic went a bit overboard. Trying to revert it a bit.
- [x] I might go over the loose ideas in the document and cross out or distribute those.
- [x] Going over the document again to reformulate.
    - [x] Might I replace 'related object' with just 'object' in certain cases for simplicity?
- [x] Pictures:
    - [x] Maybe draw new ones in one go, on paper and then scan it.
    - [x] Sometimes borrow (pieces of) other pictures
    - [x] Or simplify pictures by editing them.
- [x] I have difficulty not wanting to change the story, while the aim is to just reword it, and I seem to experience an impossibility not absorbing the story. My conundrum might be solved, by adding indicators that everything is just a suggestion, so that no idea might disrupt anything, even when I may not entirely agree with it myself.

#### 2020-06-11 Done Content Changes for Objects Chapter

- [x] Object Reference section may start with a more basic image of the concept, / along side the more composite picture it might display now.
- [x] I might be explaining multiplicity as a concept in quite some detail. Should it be more about the notation?
- [x] Outtakes:
    - [x] ~~From 'Multiplicity' (might use this text in the future again): There might be different words that can be used to express the concepts of single and multiple.~~

#### 2022-01-30 Done Tone Change Extended Steps

- [x] Word variation:
    - [x] Replacing some "may" and "might" occurrences with other words that introduce wiggle room.
- [x] Directness:
    - [x] Removing "might" and "may" where adequate wiggle room may already be present.
    - [x] Replacing indefinites back some with definites, for readability. 
    - [x] Reading over text again to reformulate for readability.
    - [x] Appropriateness:
        - [x] Definite language for comment on diagrams and syntax.
        - [x] Less definite language for philosophical opinion.
        - [x] Less definite language where ideas are iffy.
- [x] Word variation:
    - [x] Alternating evenly between words "may" and "might".
