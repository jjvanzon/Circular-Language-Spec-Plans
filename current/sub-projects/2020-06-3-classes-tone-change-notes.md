### Done

#### 2020-06-11 Done Reformulating Classes Chapter

- [x] I made text changes, which may have resulted in more trigger words again. Maybe mark those and solve those.
    - [x] Hoping to do the last time of marking and reformulating trigger words.
- [x] I am not sure this open language stuff made it much clearer. It looks to me like using more words than necessary, which may make reading it harder. But that might be specifically how I might see it. I may just be tired. Often.

#### 2020-06-11 Done Reformulating Classes Chapter

- [x] Marking trigger words in red.
- [x] Possibly mark questionable trigger words with a star (*) too.
- [x] Finding replacement words, possibly using online thesaurus.
    - [x] I seem less motivated, because I question the validity of the idea, so this action may seem futile.
    - [x] Perhaps I might appreciate the idea for what it is. Maybe not part of this Circular Language Spec, but a Circular Broader View idea. So even though I might not use it in Circular Language Spec, I might still appreciate it as an idea outside of that.
    - [x] I get anxiety if something seems unuseful to me. It's a thing.
    - [x] I am done with this, but I feel uneasy about the ideas. 
- [x] I might go over the loose ideas in the document and cross out or distribute those.
- [x] Going over the document again to reformulate.
    - [x] I also have second thoughts about the order of subjects.
    - [x] I am not well able to follow text right now, it appears, so this might be for later.
    - [x] Maybe not literally follow the words, maybe shift around topics and draw pictures, to make it better.
- [x] Pictures:
    - [x] Maybe draw new ones in one go, on paper and then scan it.
    - [x] Sometimes borrow (pieces of) other pictures
    - [x] Or simplify pictures by editing them.
    - [x] Maybe write out more what the pictures mean precisely.
        - [x] Now that I do that, some fragments seem duplicates. 'Using Dashed Shapes' now seems a repetition of things said elsewhere.
- [x] I have difficulty not wanting to change the story, while the aim is to just reword it, and I seem to experience an impossibility not absorbing the story. My conundrum might be solved, by adding indicators that everything is just a suggestion, so that no idea might disrupt anything, even when I may not entirely agree with it myself.
