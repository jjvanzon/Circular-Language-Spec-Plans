- [ ] __Moves to: Pointers / Text Code / Implementations / Construct Drafts__
- [ ] __Loose ideas: regroup or clear out__

### Information

#### Stereotyping Fragments

As a helper for reorganizing content, fragments of content might first be *stereotyped* before moving them, by annotating them with for instance the following stereotypes:

- Reasons:
    - Integrate
        - `<< nice formulation >>`
        - `<< synonym >>`
    - Move to another chapter or section
        - `<< move >>`
        - `<< pointers >>`
        - `<< commands compared to objects >>`
        - `<< creation behavior of commands >>`
        - `<< parameters >>`
        - ...
    - Move to Broader View
        - `<< broader view >>`
        - `<< applications >>`
        - `<< other technology >>`
    - Move to Construct Drafts
        - `<< construct draft >>`
        - `<< rule rich >>`
        - `<< detail >>`
        - `<< details >>`
        - `<< terminology >>`
        - `<< implementation >>`
        - `<< text code >>`
        - `<< edge case >>`
    - Remove perhaps:
        - `<< already covered >>`
        - `<< repeated >>`
        - `<< interpretation issues >>`

### TODO

#### 2021-05-02 TODO Moving Around Texts

- [x] Parameters articles
    - [x] Switching to "parameter passing" approach instead of "commands & classes loosely coupled".
    - [x] Updating README listings.
- [ ] __Parameter Passing__
    - [x] 🍱 Stereotyping content fragments
    - [ ] 🚚 __Moving around content__
- [ ] 🦹‍♂️ Stereotyping content fragments
- [ ] 🚚 Moves to: Pointers / Text Code / Implementations / Construct Drafts / Broader View.
- [ ] 💡 Loose Ideas: regroup or clear out.
- [ ] ⚡ Brainstorm: I seem to have difficulty not changing the tone of texts too.
- [ ] Might only do *Spec*.
- [ ] ->.. Postponed: Broader View: WAS AT: "Diagram & Text Code Expression".

### Postponed

#### 2021-04-05 Postponed Content Reorganization

- [ ] `<< moving around text >>`
    - [ ] ~ Reorganizing "Fundamental Principles"
        - [ ] ~ One doc for Exchangeability?
        - [ ] ~ One doc for Extensibility?
- [ ] `<< not sure >>`
    - [ ] ~ Some planning docs titles end with "plan", but what's inside seem mostly "notes". But might it matter much?
- [ ] `<< chapter reorganization >>`
    - [ ] Switching "Parameters" approach between "Spec" and "Construct Drafts" replacing the "Commands & Classes Loosely Coupled" approach with the "Input Output" approach.
    - [ ] ~ Splitting up Black Box Construct Drafts (they seem disparate topics)

#### 2020-05-14 Postponed Circular Broader View / Construct Drafts Neater Folders

- Making folder sub-division neater of "Framework" (inside Software-System-Docs), now that the topics have found a new place. 

### Done

#### 2021-04-13 Done Moving Around Texts

- [x] 🐤 Nested Commands Rule Rich
    - [x] ~ May move deprecated interpretation to *Nested Commands* article.
    - [x] "Nested Commands Rule Rich" article fragments may be moved.
        - [x] Re-stereotyped fragments.
        - [x] Moving fragments around
- [x] ⏹ WAS AT: Commands Loose Ideas (by order of TOC)
    - [x] 🗿 Changed heading levels for table of contents.
    - [x]  Stereotyping text fragments.
    - [x] 🚚 Moving around stereotyped text fragments.
- [x] Fine-tuning Commands Construct Drafts article subdivision.

#### 2021-04-27 Done Renames

- [x] Renaming "procedure" to "command".
- [x] Renaming "execution control" to "execution flow".
- [x] Renaming "spline" to "line".
- [x] 🖼 Renames in pictures
    - [x] "procedure" => "command"
    - [x] "clause" => "nested command"
    - [x] "spline" => "line"
    - [x] *.png
    - [x] *.jpeg
    - [x] ~~*.jpg~~ > No relevant pictures.
    - [x] ~~*.bmp~~ > No relevant pictures.
    - [x] Strategy:
        - [x] +/- 2000 pictures total.
        - [x] Inspected roughly.
        - [x] Amount of pictures to change overseeable.
        - [x] For some use paper, others paint.NET.
- [x] May rename "clause" to "nested command".
    - [x] Mapping between terms:
        - [x] 'active nested command' => 'code block'
        - [x] 'inactive nested command' => 'clause' / 'local function' / 'lambda expression'
        - [x] Whether it is named or not, might be trivial.
        - [x] 'clause' traditionally: a piece of code inside another statement?
    - [x] Checking if already done changes are in-line with these definitions.
    - [x] "Clause Access" => "Access from Nested Commands".

#### 2021-04-13 Done Brainstorm Renaming "Clause" to "Nested Command"

- [x] (Perhaps it is the original IT terminology that makes things difficult to define, not Circular itself.)
- [x] It seems so difficult to not have a single name for this.
- [x] Perhaps one that does not collide with existing terminology.
- [x] 'Embedded command' maybe. 'Nested commands'?
- [x] But it would exclude command references and command calls. That makes embedded commands a bit ambiguous. Nested commands might be the best candidate.
- [x] Perhaps it may be a relief to call them nested commands, sometimes distinguishing between active nested command and inactive nested command.
- [x] The term "clause" might still be used for execution flow statements.

#### 2021-04-21 Done Brainstorm Moving Loose Ideas

Conclusion: Moving loose ideas to *Construct Drafts* may be preferred.

- [x] Would I move a loose idea to...
    - [x] a chapter's main document,
    - [x] a chapter's loose ideas document,
    - [x] a construct drafts article or
    - [x] a sub-project document?
- [x] Too many options?
- [x] Reasons seem to contradict.
    - [x] *In main document:*
        - [x] It seems unclean to me to add a loose ideas section to main articles.
    - [x] *Ideas grouped together:*
        - [x] I might also value that ideas about similar topic are grouped together. That might be a 'pro' for moving it to the main article about a topic.
    - [x] *Separate Loose Ideas article:*
        - [x] But I think a separate loose ideas document though it seems clean, is something I might only apply if a chapter might have multiple articles.
    - [x] *Single chapter article:*
        - [x] But I think I want chapters to consist of only one document preferably.
    - [x] *To Construct Drafts:*
        - [x] I think the distinction between move to construct draft or not might be if I expect I might want an idea to be part of the spec or probably not.
- [x] *How important is the idea?* It might be a matter of how important I think the idea is to put it in the main document.
- [x] It may also be a generally ok idea to put loose ideas about a construct in construct drafts, and not leave it lingering in a reasonably polished up chapter.
- [x] So except for the *sub-project* document option, the preferred place might be a loose ideas document per topic in the Construct Drafts section.
- [x] That leaves me unclear about when yo put it in a sub-project document. I think a sub-project document might be good for the highlights of what work could be done. I think content that goes into a topic deeper, could be better off in Construct Draft.
- [x] I think I might have found the preferred place for loose ideas to group under different topics: a Loose Ideas document per topic in Construct Drafts.
- [x] \> So the first idea wanted to move out of Commands Loose Ideas might go in Construct Drafts > Basic Diagram Elements Loose Ideas?

#### 2021-04-13 Done Content Reorganization

- [x] 🗿 Correcting headings for auto-generated tables of contents.
    - [x] ~~Aspects As External Modules~~
    - [x] Text Code Loose Ideas
    - [x] Type Safety, Generic, Explicit
    - [x] Execution Flow Loose Ideas

#### 2021-04-19 Done Content Reorganization: Commands Misc Issues

- [x] Stereotyping fragments
- [x] 🚗 Moved "Parent Controls Its Sub-Executions" to Commands Construct Drafts.
- [x] 🦚 Moving Referrers topics to separate article under Pointers.
- [x] ⏺ Moved This Argument ideas from Commands Misc Issues to Parapeters Loose Ideas.

#### 2021-04-13 Done Content Reorganization: Commands Example Diagrams

- [x] ~~Probably no moves or loose ideas to regroup.~~
- [x] But I sort of trip over my use of the word 'clause'.
- [x] The systematic exposition, seems to rely on word clause.
- [x] ~~Can I change the term I use for it?~~
- [x] Or describing it in an Introduction section.
- [x] 🖼 Adding pictures of basic concepts to introduction.

#### 2021-04-16 Done Creation Behavior of Commands, Content Reorganization

- [x] Brainstorm:
    - [x] The creation behavior seems such a specific implementation.
    - [x] I can imagine implementing it differently.
    - [x] The general outlines seem to clarify a problem.
    - [x] For instance where it says: Private contents are copied. That may be in prototype based instantiation. But in class based instantiation, 'static' parts might not be copied, though they might be visible in the object.
    - [x] In a general explanation it might not matter.
    - [x] I am not sure object parameter lines are 'already set'. Perhaps they might sneakily be assignment calls.
    - [x] ~~Perhaps even the diagram part is specific implementation.~~ > Sort of.
    - [x] ~~Perhaps more general formulation (with pictures) might be left in the spec.~~
    - [x] ~~The rest might be moved to Implementations.~~
    - [x] The diagrams seem to clarify, which may add value to the spec.
    - [x] O, wait, I see, the conceptual explanation and diagram notation still seem separately described.
    - [x] Comparison to CPU-Like Call Instantian seems movable to Implementations.
- [x] Steps:
    - [x] Moving Comparison to CPU-like calls to Implementation.
    - [x] Merging conceptual descriptions with diagram descriptions.
    - [x] Adding introduction section.
    - [x] Distribute Loose Ideas over different articles.
    - [x] Might formulate some things more generally:
        - [x]  Parameter lines: being actual references or imposter assignments might both be presented as options. > Added a section just about this.
        - [x] "Copied from definition": May formulate more generally: "shown as a copy [ ... ]" (code might not be copied, depending on implementation.)

#### 2021-04-13 Done Classes Content Reorganization

- [x] 🖼 Classes chapter: Fine-tuned image sizes.
- [x] 📑 Classes chapter: Fixing heading levels for table of contents.
- [x] 💄 Classes chapter: Gave `<< stereotyping >>` an alternative style: inline code.

#### 2021-04-12 Done Content Reorganization

- [x] ⤵ Moves to "Implementations" searching for 0.9 / 2.0 / 3.0
    - [x] Perhaps first tag the occurrences with `<< implementation >>`
    - [x] 😦 Quite some occurrences seems to raise questions.
    - [x] Reasons not to move to "Implementations":
            - [x] Referencing an experiment might just support the conceptual explanation.
            - [x] It is already in "Implementations"
    - [x] Searching for 0.9
    - [x] Searching for 2.0
    - [x] Searching for 3.0
    - [x] Searching for `<< implementation >>` and perhaps move texts.
- [x] .. Moving around text:
    - [x] ⚡ Brainstorm: Moving "Loose Ideas" to "Construct Drafts"
        - [x] Obs: I am looking at Basic Diagram Element's Loose Ideas section.
        - [x] Q: Might I move all the Loose Ideas sections to Construct Drafts? Pros? Cons?
        - [x] Pro: Cleaner main text
        - [x] Con: Less easily found?
        - [x] Pro: Construct drafts might be 'known territory', not really 'forbidden territory'.
    - [x] ⚡ Brainstorm: Moving "Static" to "Construct Drafts"?
        - [x] Hyp: This might clear out much of the spec, if I might apply that rule to more.
        - [x] Hyp: Without unfinished ideas, there may not be a (preliminary) spec to speak of?
        - [x] Conc: So maybe not.
        - [x] ~~But Static > Loose Ideas might be weeded out.~~ > Not much to move.

#### 2021-04-11 Done Brainstorm "Design Time = Run Time" Reformulations / The I form

Do I start in the I form here? I had the idea to put things in the I form. This might be my 'solution' for presenting unsound, non-bullet proof ideas. So there is admission of subjectiveness. Also all the opinions I wanted to present, may be expressed with doubt built into it ('may', 'might', 'perhaps', 'maybe'). So no statement may be wrong or right and it might not really matter nor make the text invalid.

A diversion to an Errors article may be appropriate.

#### 2021-04-10 Done Replacement Terms

- [x] Replacing "new computer language" with "Circular".
    - [x] In Circular-Language-Spec
    - [x] In Circular-Language-Spec-Plans
- [x] Experiments 0.4 / 0.9 / 2.0 / 3
    - [x] Different names for these versions / implementations?
    - [x] ~~"experimental version x.x of a new computer language"?~~
    - [x] ~~"Code generator experiment 0.4 / 0.9"~~
    - [x] ~~"Engine experiment 2.0"~~
    - [x] ~~Or just: Creator 0.4, Creator 0.9, Creator 2.0 and Circle 3? Just the names they had?~~
    - [x] >> Or "experiment x.x"?
    - [x] In the Circular-Language-Spec repo:
    - [x] In the Circular-Language-Spec-Plans repo:
    - [x] Searching for 0.4
    - [x] Searching for 0.9
    - [x] Searching for 2.0
    - [x] Searching for 3
    - [x] ~~Renaming 2.0 to 2.~~ > May make less searchable.
    - [x] 🏷 Renaming experiment 3 to experiment 3.0
- [x] 🔢 Renaming "Object Order" to "Sequence Order".
- [x] 🔮 Made clearer when "3.0" references a future version.

#### 2021-04-07 Done Content Reorganization

- [x] Headings more uniform
- [x] Circular-Language-Spec tables of contents
- [x] Circular-Language-Spec-Plan tables of contents
- [x] Overview might be given links.
- [x] Renaming "In a Diagram" sections to just "Diagram"
- [x] Renaming "System Objects" chapter to "System Interfaces"
- [x] Increased Pointers heading levels for table of contents.
- [x] Repeating some of root README in spec README

#### 2021-04-07 Done Replacing "Concept" with "Aspect"

- [x] Replacing "Concept" with "Aspect"
    - [x] I have difficulty with this. 
    - [x] Only part of the occurrences seem replaceable.
    - [x] "Concept" had such a nice ring to it.
    - [x] Maybe some other way to be selective?
    - [x] Certain files perhaps?
    - [x] Circular-Language-Spec
        - [x] "Construct Drafts" README
        - [x] "Aspects"
        - [x] "Command as an Aspect Brainstorm Texts"
        - [x] "Broader View Loose Ideas"
        - [x] "Concepts as External Modules"
        - [x] "Access Control Loose Ideas"

        - [x] Searching for "external module"
        - [x] Searching for "coding concept"
        - [x] Searching for "a aspect"

#### 2021-04-05 Done Pretty URL's for Planning Docs

- [x] Webby paths for planning docs:
    - [x] Checking readme's / links.

#### 2021-04-05 Done Reorganizing Planning Docs roughly

- [x] The term "Language Design"
    - [x] That alone might not distinguish it as a planning doc. It may still look like a title for a doc in the spec.
- [x] Shorter file names for Main Project docs (+ the ones in Out of Scope).
- [x] Cleaning up "Sub Projects (Out of Scope)" formatting.
- [x] README.MD in some folders 
    - [x] Current

    - [x] Merging the Revamp goals might not apply as much to "Out of Scope" topics.
    - [x] But moving things from 'In Scope' to 'Out of Scope' might be relevant.

#### 2020-05-27 Done Merging More Commands Articles Together

- [x] Redirection and recursion seem to have some overlap conceptually.
- [x] Maybe "05. Comparison to CPU-Like Calls belongs in 04. Creation Behavior Of Commands."
- [x] "01. Commands Main Concepts > Larger" > Keep separate
- [x] "02. Start & Stop > Larger" > Keep separate
- [x] "03. Parent Controls Its Sub-Executions" > Medium sized > Misc-ish

#### 2020-05-26 Done Merging More System Objects Articles Together

- [x] Last time it seems I only merged together a few large groups of articles into their main topic.
- [x] Right now I feel maybe the first 5 could be merged into one.
- [x] Along with some main topics, I feel there are loose topics. Maybe those loose topics could be grouped together with something.
- [x] I think Connectors and Connections is something I might want to combine into one article.
- [x] Assignment I might like to keep separate for now.
- [x] System Command Call Notations too. It's kind of large and honestly a bit questionable, so I might like to keep that separate.
- [x] I am thinking the remaining 4 relatively small articles, might be combined into a System Objects Misc article.
- [x] "01. System Objects" > Larger > Keep separate
- [x] "02. Assignment" > Medium sized > Keep separate
- [x] "03. System Command Call Notations" > Larger > Keep separate
- [x] "04. Connectors" > Smaller > Combined into Connectors & Connections.
- [x] "05. Connections" > Medium sized > Combined into Connectors & Connections.
- [x] "06. System Command Calls by User" > Small > Put into single article System Objects Misc Issues.
- [x] "07. Objects Floating Around" > Small > Put into single article System Objects Misc Issues.
- [x] "08. System Command Extension" > Small > Put into single article System Objects Misc Issues.
- [x] "09. Parameters For Objects" > Medium sized > Put into single article System Objects Misc Issues.
- [x] "10. List Concept" > Medium sized > Keep separate
- [x] "11. System Objects Ideas" > Larger > Keep separate

#### 2020-05-25 Done Merging More Relationships Articles Together

I feel merging the articles together is not something I necessarily want to do right now. I am not sure why those two things are connected to each other in my view.

I guess I feel I might want to polish up the way I explain things, before I put effort into merging the articles together at all? Are the articles not particularly small, like some of the articles I merged together before?

Some articles are smallish or sort of medium sized. I think I could just make it one article. That may make it more manageable the way I might like. I do not see my not entirely agreeing with the concept anymore as standing in the way of that.

Still want to change the fonts.

#### 2020-05-16 Done Formatting and Article Merging and Distributing

- [x] ~~Maybe put Type Control out of scope? > Deemed less important to consider right now.~~
- [x] So, what's next?
- [x] I think nothing to reorganize anymore about the file structure of Circular Language Spec.
- [x] Maybe start with the texts?
- [x] ~~Option: Convert to docx. > Too many docs.~~
- [x] Option: If there are still Text Code topics, they might be moved to Circular Construct Drafts.
- [x] Structure changes:
    - [x] Making back ground black?
    - [x] Changing main headers?
    - [x] Removing the footers?
    - [x] Removing 'see also' references?
    - [x] Convert to docx.
    - [x] Merging or redistributing articles?
    - [x] Putting each conceptual and diagram explanation together in an article.
- [x] Chapters:
    - [x] Circular Language Spec Overview
    - [x] Basic Diagram Elements
    - [x] Objects
    - [x] Classes
    - [x] Relationships
    - [x] System Objects
    - [x] Commands
    - [x] Parameters
    - [x] Module
    - [x] Execution Control
    - [x] Black Boxing
    - [x] Interfaces
    - [x] Events
    - [x] Inheritance
    - [x] > The next are 26 documents total. I might do formatting for all of them in one go. None of the folders seem to have large sets of articles anymore.
    - [x] Type Control
    - [x] Object Resolution
    - [x] Conditions
    - [x] Sequence Order
    - [x] Uncategorized
    - [x] Other Diagram Topics
    - [x] Summaries of Other Languages
    - [x] Previous Versions

#### 2020-05-24 Done Merging and Redistributing Remaining Articles

Maybe going into detail about this is not part of the editing phase I am putting these articles through.
This is what the Circular Language Spec Overview calls the 'unfinished' part. So for that reason it seems less straight forward.
It is also harder to subdivide, because it is multiple different issues, unlike previous tasks I did, which were just about 1 main topic.
The question I have for myself is how much is worth doing with regards to these topics.
Some things I'd like to do.
But I might want to be selective about it.

- [x] ~~"Type Safety, Genericity, Explicit"~~
    - [x] Already 1 article. The topic seems to deserve its own spot.
- [x] ~~"21. Object Resolution"~~
    - [x] Seems all of the articles might be put in one article, because I estimate these are not big issues separately.
    - [x] A lot of the text is preliminary.
    - [x] I do see this as being appropriate as a separate chapter, I think.
    - [x] I do not see much of a reason to put effort into this right now.
    - [x] It's kind of messy and when putting it into one article now, I may lose the overview that the split up into articles gives me now.
- [x] ~~Conditions~~
    - [x] These 3 articles could become 1.
    - [x] It seems that if content is still messy, the split up into multiple articles might have value, because it seems to create overview.
    - [x] Just added some comment on other content about Conditions to find elsewhere.
- [x] "23. Sequence Order"
    - [x] Is one article.
    - [x] But not a big one.
    - [x] Makes me wonder if some topics are handy as a separate chapter or better grouped into another main topic.
    - [x] Eventually might move to the Objects chapter, but might keep it in its own folder for now.
- [x] "This"
    - [x] I think I already had a place in mind for that, to move this article to a different main topic. I think tso Commands, but I think I put that down in the planning doc Circular Language Spec Product List.
    - [x] Circular Language Spec Product List says that it should belong in the Commands chapter.
- [x] "Redirection"
    - [x] Circular Language Spec Product List might not seem to assign a specific existing Chapter to it. It says 'ref-ness'? Maybe that pointer to pointer situations might all be put in a separate chapter, this might also belong there?
    - [x] It talks about 'target symbols'.
    - [x] There are several target symbol topics in e.g. the chapters Objects, Classes and Interfaces.
    - [x] Maybe that can all go to a chapter about ref-ness, or whatever generic term I might find for it.
    - [x] If it is just about target symbols, maybe the topics are already covered by the previous content.
    - [x] It might seem to be about redirecting e.g. the object aspect and then about tracing to the final target object/class/interface after following the redirections.
    - [x] I do like the idea of a Pointers chapter or something.
    - [x] This content might seem to be covered elsewhere.
    - [x] Perhaps I should just make a folder 'Pointers' and put it there, and a readme just to make a point, that it could just become a separate chapter.
- [x] "30. Misc Diagram Topics"
    - [x] I think this is appropriate as a separate chapter.
    - [x] "1. Diagram Expression Introduction" > Larger
    - [x] "2. About Programming In General" > Larger
    - [x] "3. Diagram Metrics" > Larger or might be.
    - [x] "4. Coloring" > Smaller
    - [x] "6.0. Example Diagrams Introduction" > Small
        - [x] Maybe move to the folder 6.1. Example Diagrams? Maybe call it Readme?
- [x] "7. Summaries of Other Languages"
    - [x] Larger
- [x] "32. Previous Versions"
    - [x] This folder structure seems off when there is essentially only one version, as one document in it.
    - [x] (There used to be multiple versions in one folder. Those were put out of scope of the Circular Language Spec.)

#### 2020-05-23 Done Merging Inheritance Articles Together

Most of them are quite small.
Grouping together main concepts into one article might make sense.
Specialization is mostly small articles, but quite a few of them. But maybe combine those into one article.
The articles that follow do not seem to be many or they are already larger ones I might not want to group together.

- 28. Deeper Specialization.docx > Larger > Might probably keep it separate.
- 29. Alternate Version Through Inheritance > Smaller
    - > Maybe move this detail elsewhere.
        Might not be worth an entirely separate article.
- 30.1. Extending System Objects (Older) > Larger
    - > Not sure what the status of this is? It has the word 'Older' in it.
        Is it deprecated? Covered elsewhere already?
        I don't know. But at this stage maybe I do not need to know.
- 30.1. Extending System Objects in a Diagram (Older) > Medium-sized / smaller
    - > Might probably merge it with the main article.
- 31. Inheritance Ideas > Medium-sized
```

#### 2020-05-22 Done Merging Events Articles Together

Possibly this is one you want to put into a single document.  
Most of them are small.
"13. Qualified Event Names" should be out of scope, since it is about text code?  
The articles before 'System Events' might be put into one article.  
I might put System Events in one article.  
System Events can almost be demoted to a Construct Draft, but just like System Objects is in there, I might want to keep System Events part of the Circular Language Spec (for now). (The correspondence between System Objects and System Events is that they seem more like part of a run-time or if Circular might function more like a stand-alone language, rather than mostly a diagram notation).  
The last 3 articles might become a single 'misc' article. But perhaps some of them have a place in the main article.

```
- 01. Events Introduction > Smaller
- 02. Prime Event Example, Button Clicked > Smaller
- 03. Events Main Concepts > Smallish
- 04. Event Situations > Smallish
- 05. Explicit Implementation of Event Object > Smaller
- 06. Explicit Interface of Event Object > Smaller
- 07. Event Interface Reference > Smaller

- 09.        System Events in Normal Notation > Smaller
- 10.        Simplified System Event Notation > Medium sized
- 11.        System Event Parameters > Medium sized / smaller
- 12.        System Event Design Choices > Smaller
- 13. Qualified Event Names > Smaller << out of scope >>
- 14. Interaction Events > Smaller
- 15. Black Boxing Events > Medium sized / smaller
- 16. Event Alternatives> Smaller
- 99. Ideas > Smallish
```

#### 2020-05-22 Done Merging Interfaces Articles Together

```
- 01. Interfaces Introduction > Small
- 02. Interfaces Main Concepts.docx > Medium sized
- 03. Interface Aspect.docx > Small

- 22. Extensive Classification with Interfaces (Unfinished).docx > Small << construct draft >>
- 99. Interfaces Ideas.docx > Small > Move to main article.
```

None of the articles are that big. The size differences are a bit all over the place.
Logically I might group together all Interface Aspects articles.
The Intro and Main Concepts seem logical to group.
I think I'll just start with those and take it from there.
There's something about text code in Interface Assignment Types. That could be moved to Circular Construct Drafts.
Maybe move the Loose Ideas all to a separate article at the end.

I discuss problems with interface reliability in case of automatically established bidirectional relationships. The idea of always having bidirectional relationships between things is something I want to distance myself from in the Circular Language Spec, and perhaps leave as a topic for Circular Construct Drafts. But right now the idea seems embedded into the Circular Language Spec, and without significant modification, it might not seem you can deprecate it yet. I think such redesign of Relationships may take place in the future (to leave out automatic bidirectional relationships). But I think it is only then that I also adapt the text about this edge cases. So the question that worried me is whether it is out of scope or not. The answer for now seems to be: no, it is in scope, but the design of the concept of Relationships may be changed in later efforts.

#### 2020-05-20 Done Merging Black Boxes Articles Together

There are quite a few relatively small articles.
But I have doubts how to group them to bigger articles.
I do not think I want to group them together just in one big article.
I might just go for it, grouping the first smaller articles into a bigger one.

- Smaller, integrated into a single article:
    - "01. Black Box Introduction"
    - "02. Black Box Main Concepts"
    - "03. Public & Private"
    - "04. Friend Declaration"
    - "05. Notations of Private"
    - "06. Friend Declaration in Instances"
    - "07. Public & Friend Connections"
    - "08. Access Controlling Aspects"
    - "09. Object-Bound, Reference-Bound & Access Control"
    - "13. Assignment between Friend Members"
    - "14. Friend = Wavy Line"
- Group these together:
    - "10. Public & Private Connectors > Kinda medium sized"
    - "11. Public & Private Connections > Relatively bigger."
    - "12. Public & Private Assignment > Kinda medium sized."
- Putting these together in one article:
    - "20. Black Box Miscellaneous Issues"
        - Looks unfinished.
        - Objects Take Over Class Access Control: Might move to article Black Boxes, section Friend Declarations in Instances.
    - "21. Black Box Side-Issues"
        - Looks unfinished.
        - Might move these Circular Broader View:
            - Black Boxing and User Access Control
            - Programmers and Users
    - "22. Black Box Details, May Cover Last"
        - Unfinished drafts.
        - Might move these Circular Construct Drafts:
            - Level Limitation
            - Module Level Limitation
            - Downsides to Black Boxes
            - Get For Access and Get For Copy
            - Inaccessible System Aspects
            - Compared to Traditional Black Boxing (goes in too deep on automatic containment)
            - Other Details
        - Special case:
            - Simplified Access Connectors: I think those ideas could be moved to Simplified Access Control Notation, because that is what they are about. Big brainstorm though.
    - "23. Black Box Details, Might Not Cover"
        - Same as above.
        - Moving it to Circular Construct Drafts after some considerations.
- "23.3. Black Box Details, May Not Cover, Simplified Access Control Expression in a Diagram"
    - Left it for what it is. Am not calling it unfinished. It seems finished. Maybe might change in the future, but it looks like a worked out idea.
- Moved from Circular Language Spec to Circular Construct Drafts:
    - "23.1. Black Box Details, May Not Cover, Simplified Access Control Expression"
    - "23.2. Black Box Details, May Not Cover, Simplified Access Control Expression in Text Code"

#### 2020-05-20 Done Merging Execution Control Articles Together

- [x] I think I want to merge it into the following set of articles:
    - [x] "1.0.1. Introduction to Execution Control"
    - [x] "2.0.1. Conditional Execution"
    - [x] "3.0.1. Loops"
    - [x] "4.0.1. Jumps"
    - [x] "5.0.1. Loop-Related Jumps"
- [x] Reason: I had almost merged it into one document, but I like how the separate documents seem to nicely categorize the different kinds of execution control. Also: merging it into one document might give me a tendency to use more heading levels and the styling for those is not optimal yet. Not a strong argument maybe, but it might make me think: More heading levels might be 'proof' that a separation in several articles is not a bad thing.
- [x] I just wanted to save some time merging each pair of documents lots of times only to merge them into a larger document again.
- [x] Taking a look at how it looks now.

#### 2020-05-20 Done Merging Parameters Articles Together

- [x] ~~Maybe merge all the Parameters content into one article if it is not too much.~~
- [x] Relatively small:
    - [x] "02.0. Parameter Passing.docx:"
    - [x] "03.0. Joint Display of Access Connectors and Object Relationships.docx"
    - [x] Moved their text to the "Miscellaneous Parameter Topics" article.
- [x] "05.0. Imported Parameter Concepts"
    - [x] Not large topics. Maybe Required & Optional is a bit larger. Half of it or so is idea texts, but not bad ones I think. Basically just the version from the previous version of the documentation (Symbol Language.doc).
    - [x] Merging together seems appropriate.
- [x] "10.0. Miscellaneous Parameter Topics"
    - [x] Also not large articles.
    - [x] Merging together seems appropriate.
- [x] ~~I think I want to merge things together in phases, before I decide whether or not I want to turn it into just one bigger article.~~

#### 2020-05-18 Done Merging Commands Articles Together

- [x] I still mean to rename the docs so the 'in a Diagram suffixes are gone.
- [x] Could not see a pattern in what I might want browsing the first few documents.
- [x] Maybe I want to group the first ones into a Main Concepts article.
- [x] I might want to inspect it some more in search of ideas.
- [x] Main Concepts:
    - [x] I suspect I might like to put the 10 documents Commands.docx until Active Clause.docx in one document.
- [x] Hard to group:
    - [x] Start & Stop.docx until 13.1. Changing Inactive to Executable.docx the articles are sort of medium sized and hard to view as a group together, I think.
- [x] Personal feeling: I think the information rate is too high for me now. Lots of topics rush by my eyes at a large pace and my energy level is dropping.
- [x] Even if I do not know how I could group together many of the articles logically, if I can find a few groups, that might already benefit the overviewability of the topic list.
- [x] ~~These are small:~~
    - [x] ~~"15.0. Command References Inside Commands.docx"~~
    - [x] ~~"16.2. Executables & Executions.docx"~~
    - [x] ~~"17.1. Procedure.docx"~~
    - [x] ~~"18. Resolution When Not Allowed For Commands.docx"~~
    - [x] ~~"22.0.     Sub-Commands Not Manually Started.docx"~~
- [x] "19. Parent Controls Its Sub-Executions.docx":
    - [x] Seems like the 3 articles after it are part of it, but not sure.
- [x] Creation behavior:
    - [x] There seem 8 'Creation Behavior' articles. They might not be small, but grouping them to one article might tidy up. Also, it might not seem to me a topic you always want to see in detail. Maybe look at it once and say "Ok, so that's how that could work." Now the topic is quite prominently present in the article list.
- [x] These seem groupable:
    - [x] "35.2. Inactive Command Object Redirection.docx"
    - [x] "36.1. Inactive Command Class Redirection.docx"
    - [x] "37.2. Executable Command Class Redirection.docx"
    - [x] "38.2. Executable Command Object Redirection.docx"
- [x] These seem groupable:
    - [x] "39.1. Target Command Object.docx"
    - [x] "40.1. Target Command Definition.docx"
    - [x] Or maybe put in Command Redirection.
    - [x] Those two have loose ideas in them.
    - [x] I might not want to stop myself from merging articles that have loose ideas. (My argument against it seems to be: It might get messy.)
    - [x] I also might not want to step away from the 'put loose ideas where they belong'.
    - [x] So maybe I want to accept that some loose ideas get spread a little over the content here and there.
    - [x] The idea with the loose ideas was to go through them at some point seeing if any of it is still usable or not and then maybe discard them, or integrate the ideas into the content. Something like that.
- [x] Out of scope? 42.0. Implementation of System Commands.docx
- [x] Example diagrams:
    - [x] Maybe put them all in one article.
    - [x] ~~Maybe rename and see what they mean.~~
- [x] Some topics' titles look like main concepts to me. I want to evaluate later if I want to move them to Commands Main Concepts.docx.
    - [x] Maybe if ut were'd for the Start and Stop article in between I might just move more to Commands Main Concepts.
    - [x] Consider merging the content of these with into the Commands Main Concepts.docx:
    - [x] "13. Reading & Writing Parameters.docx"
- [x] Merge these two:
    - [x] "17. Command Object Referrers.docx"
    - [x] "18. Command Definition Referrers.docx"

#### 2020-05-18 Done Merging System Objects Articles Together

- [x] Deciding what to do with these, was a bit intense. Especially when I hit a part of the content I have reservations about.
- [x] System Commands:
    - [x] Articles for the various aspects might be merged to one article. Those are like 15 articles or so. Most of them are small. 3 of them are a bit larger.
- [x] System Interfaces:
    - [x] Articles for the various system objects might be put together into one. Not that all of them are small. Just that enough of them are. It seems a bit of a hinder to open them one by one. A single article might make browsing the content easier. The amount of articles might be more overwhelming that an article that has some pages.
- [x] Assignment + subtopics
    - [x] May be turned onto 1 article.
- [x] I think the main parts may become more obvious from the article list if I merge together more articles into one.
- [x] System Command Call Notations:
    - [x] 4 smaller, 3 larger
    - [x] Not sure if for the size of them I might merge them together.
    - [x] It is kind of one topic.
- [x] ~~Misc topics at the end:~~
    - [x] ~~Not sure yet if merging is appropriate.~~

#### 2020-05-16 Done Reorganize Circular Language Spec Files

- [x] The bulk of the content is in the Coding Concepts.
- [x] Diagram Expression content:
    - [x] Is now in more than 1 place.
    - [x] "1. Diagram Expression" folder:
        - [x] Describes Basic Diagram Elements.
        - [x] The argument, that the diagram elements might be quickly introduced at the beginning, I am not sure about that anymore. So not sure if this actually should be at the beginning of the documentation anymore.
    - [x] "6. Expression\1. Diagrams"
        - [x] Seems less finished up. I am not sure I might want to put that at the top of the documentation or at least not in this state.
    - [x] "7. Other Topics\9. Old or Boring\About Programming In General.doc"
        - [x] This is old text, that when rewritten I might even want as the introduction text that the Circular Language Spec starts with, or maybe just part of it.
        - [x] Is not really a diagram expression topic specifically.
- [x] ~~I might want to somehow merge those diagram topics together.~~
- [x] And put the Coding Concepts sub-folders just in the root.
- [x] In what order might I 'mix' the Coding Concepts and the Diagram Expression topics?
    - [x] Brainstorm: I don't think I want to just start with the Objects chapter. I do like that something starts with the overview. Right now that is the Basic Diagram Elements. Later it may be something else. I think I might keep Basic Diagram Element at the top. Then just the code concepts. Then Other Diagram Expression Topics, just a new folder, a flattened out version of the old.
    - [x] I guess I am just making a flatter list of things and keeping most of the order.
    - [x] 'About Programming In General.doc' 
        - [x] Could be put at the top as the introduction.
        - [x] Actually, just reading it over, I think it may be still to rough of a text, that I want to make a bit more neutral, before making it the main thing to start with.
        - [x] It and other bits of texts from the original Symbol Language.doc may compose a new introduction to the Circular language after some reformulating.
        - [x] All in all, I think this content is a but rough for putting at the beginning of the documentation.
- [x] There is a clash in index pages. "Code Concepts.doc" and "Language.doc" may need to become one and cleaned up.
- [x] Moving "Language.doc" content to "Code Concepts.doc" in a controlled fashion.
    - [x] There is no heading 'Sequence Order'.
- [x] I think I am just going to knead the content.
- [x] The folder subdivision is now much simpler.
- [x] "8.Previous Versions" folder:
    - [x] Has the version of the documentation: Symbol Language.doc.
    - [x] Also contains those Symbol Pictures. I do not want to publish all of them.
    - [x] I do not think I want this document in the published material: D:\Source\JJs Software\Software System Docs\1.1. Circular Language Spec\8. Previous Versions\2004-00-00 XX    Symbol Language\Other Files\Coding.txt.
    - [x] Or rather, this has some content in it, that I find questionable.
    - [x] I see two zips with pictures.
    - [x] How do I handle this? In the future I want to go list out all files in the history and remove things from the history that I do not want to publish. Those zips might become one of those files.
    - [x] But when I clean up the current state, might I find all the files back that I want to remove from history? Some have obvious file names. So I guess I might.
    - [x] I question whether I even want to include those example diagrams. Or whether I want to include them in this state.
    - [x] Or maybe I will need them for a better quality referenced image? Nah, I doubt it. That seems too much work, to replace the images in the docs with possibly better images from that zip.
    - [x] It might also not be useful to readers, at least not all of it, because it is just bulky. No one might want to go through them I think.
    - [x] Perhaps a selection of it might be useful. 
    - [x] The argument 'Too interesting too throw away'. I might not agree with that anymore.
    - [x] I think most of them are also present somewhere in the documentation.
    - [x] Some of them I want to not have in source control history.
    - [x] Some I might want to keep.
    - [x] If those 2 zips with pictures are the same...
    - [x] I just compared file sizes and they are different. So the zips might not be the same.
    - [x] I could unpack and compare.
    - [x] I think if they are comparable or one is preferred over another, I could remove the other.
    - [x] I could strip one of the copies.
    - [x] Leave that one in the new documentation.
    - [x] So do I remove the one from the 'Previous Version' documentation?
    - [x] For versioning like that, I think it might have made sense to keep the one in the 'Previous Version' documentation.
    - [x] But for control over the content, that I publish, in this case I might really like one copy.
    - [x] Result of diff: 2x Thumbs.db. 4x a file that is not in 'Previous Version', but is in 'Other Diagram Topics\Example Diagrams'
    - [x] Then do I want to remove the one in 'Previous Versions'?
    - [x] I am not sure I want to unzip them first and then commit. Maybe I want to clear it out first after I unzip it, before I commit it. That might make cleaning up later easier.
    - [x] I tried to revert my commit, but it leaves behind files in my working folder.
    - [x] Reason for deleting picture: Don't want it in there.
    - [x] Reason for deleting picture: Is already visible in a document.
    - [x] Reason for deleting picture: It has private info seen right through the paper.
    - [x] Some of them I have a hard time saying goodbye to.
    - [x] I am beginning to think I might just want to remove all of them.
    - [x] Or most of them.
    - [x] The scanned ones probably.
    - [x] The ones certainly used in documentation or otherwise discardable.
    - [x] I think I might remove most of them, and only keep a couple.
    - [x] Oh, I am done.

#### 2020-04-01 Done Circular Language Spec Planning Docs

- [x] Empty project folders:
    - [x] I could evaluate whether those empty planning docs folders are needed.
    - [x] To me it seems odd now, that 'Errors' is put out of scope.
    - [x] I think I want to move the topics 'Errors' and 'Aspect Construct' from the Out-of-Scope document to the Circular Language Spec Planning docs.
    - [x] The 'Out-of-Scope' document os currently not just postponed items of the Circular Language Spec, but more than that: not even considered part of the Circular Language Spec project at all anymore.
    - [x] It is still not a hard rule to be set. But putting Errors and Concepts out of view, makes it sort of not the same project for the sake of Concepts and putting my head into the sand when it is about Errors. If I have ideas about these things, they do belong in the project I think. I have a hard time thinking them away.
- [x] Formatting:
    - [x] Phase-by-phase.
        - [x] Background black.
        - [x] Name spelling JJ van Zon.
        - [x] No abbreviations in folder name and file name.
        - [x] Rename 'Document' to 'Spec'?
        - [x] Suffix with 'Plan'.
        - [x] Do the above for the Current and Future Projects
        - [x] 'Project' => 'Plan'
        - [x] Leave out the word 'Plan' if obvious.
        - [x] Headings 'Circular Language Spec' + similar to folder and file name.
        - [x] 'Computer Language' => 'Circular Language'
        - [x] 'Articles' => 'Spec'
        - [x] No sub folders, just files?
            - [x] Some sub-projects contain many files.
            - [x] Flattening it out might make a big list.
            - [x] Keeping some folders but have other as loose files, makes you lose that time-line feeling.
            - [x] Too much doubt -> Postpone.
        - [x] Maybe prefix all with Circular Language Spec Plan. Then simplify the rest of the title, because Plan is already implied.
            - [x] Getting path length problems. Collapsing sub-folders with only one file after all.
        - [x] Not sure if that prefixing looks so great.
            - [x] It looks cluttered. And I cannot apply it consistently, because of path length problems. Branch. Try without prefixes.
            - [x] 'Spec Plan' somewhere in there looked ok.
            - [x] My doubts are that if this doc is in the internet, the title means a lot, so why not have it be complete? It might already have that completeness somewhere in the URL, but...
            - [x] Maybe let go of the toilet role principle and just call something 'Automatic Containment for Relationships.doc'. Not 'Plan', not 'Spec' just lazy. Maybe it is ok.
            - [x] My being better at systematics than words might be in the way. So that I don't easily decide what's clear enough.
        - [x] Convert to docx without Compatibility Mode.
            - [x] What use is that, if I want to convert it to MD instead?
            - [x] Conversion to MD is not great if I use color coding it the docs.
        - [x] Remove '& Copyright'
            - [x] > Only found 1 occurrence: 'Circular Language Spec Ideas'.
        - [x] Remove unnecessary title page white space and 'version XXXX-XX' mentioning.
        - [x] Make main heading and such not take up so much space.
        - [x] Month in the headings, so it is clear that the fact that it is a time period is leading.
            - [x] In the front or the back of the sub-project name?
            - [x] In the file names too in case they have a folder?
            - [x] ~~Months in headings: not entirely convinced about the difference of the order where the month ends up between 'Project Plans' and 'Project Summaries'.~~
        - [x] 'TODO' => 'Notes'? > Cannot find it.
        - [x] Set proofing language to English US. > I don't see the problem anymore. Maybe the conversion to docx fixed it.
        - [x] First pages layout
        - [x] Page header and footer
            - [x] I am good with no page headers and footers.
        - [x] File properties (author and such)
            - [x] If they are odd. Not that odd => Leave it there.
            - [x] Still might do Done projects.
        - [x] Update lists of contents
        - [x] Legend:
            - [x] Brainstorm: I might keep the legend as it is. It may be more work to check which colors are used where and to change it? Maybe not, maybe that might be the right way to go.
            - [x] 'Legend' => 'Legend of Symbols and Markings'?
            - [x] Use simpler color coding.
            - [x] There is ambiguity between coloring of back then and now.
                - [x] Brown meant I think postponed (indefinitely). Some share of brown even meant 'part done, part postponed'. Now brown means do not do. (And part done, part postponed is orange.)
                - [x] Light grey used to mean do not do. Now it means done.
            - [x] Normalize the legends.
            - [x] Make it 1 central document
            - [x] This document has a legend right inside it: Aspects as External Modules Spec Goal (2008-05) (postponed).docx
        - [x] Font Calibri
            - [x] Just the normal font, not the headings.
        - [x] ~~Headings do not have colors.~~
            - [x] ~~Are not going to work for me anyway, with the low brightness on my screen.~~
            - [x] ~~It starts being not so functional anymore, the changes.~~
- [x] I somehow don't trust this is all there's to it about Circular Language Spec planning docs. Look over the state of it. It *might* be fun to move on to a next topic and have something finished. But somehow I don't believe it. > It is. I lean towards the actual language spec rather than the planning, now.

#### 2020-03-22 Done Organize Planning Docs

- [x] I moved around folders, for a preliminary split up between Circular Docs and Circle 3.0 Programming projects.
- [x] I could change titles of projects inside the doc content too.
    - [x] I am unsure whether I want to call the projects 'Circular Docs'. Maybe 'Circular Language Specification'.
    - [x] I do want to go for the name 'Circular' as opposed to 'New Computer Language'.
        - [x] I don't mind that this makes my documentation stick to a name that in theory might later change. It probably will not change at all.
    - [x] But Circular Docs is too general, I think. It should be Circular Language Specification.
    - [x] I don't care for the abbreviation 'Spec'. I am not a fan of abbreviation and I don’t think it makes it much more concise or clear.
    - [x] Also: I am hitting my limit here. I'm tired and getting all sorts of symptoms.
    - [x] Circular Language Design is also an option. 'Specification' may raise expectations about finishedness.
    - [x] Circular Language Design Planning
    - [x] Circular Language Specification
    - [x] 'Specification': suggests finishedness, but might it? CSS is all sorts unfinished modules.
    - [x] Leaving out 'Specification' or 'Design': Makes distinction with Experiment 3 Programming hard to see.
    - [x] The word 'Circular' should be in it.
    - [x] The word 'Language' at least sheds light a bit on what it actually is.
    - [x] But Circular Language Specification Plan is just a long name.
    - [x] But 'New Computer Language Functional Design' was quite a long name too, so that is not an argument?
    - [x] 'Spec': Is an abbreviation. I generally dislike those, but I think in this case it is appropriate. It is adopted as a word by the community.
- [x] I could evaluate whether those empty planning docs folders are needed.
    - [x] The 'update ... articles' sub-projects
        - [x] Defined as empty project doc folders: I see some of it back in the Circular Language Spec's Strategy doc, Project Steps and Time Planning, but not in the Products doc. Some redo's are defined, be it not in Products doc. It seems the reason for redoing is not always stated. I think I should make the list complete in all the planning docs where appropriate. Then I can get rid of the remaining empty sub-project folders.
        - [x] Mentioned them in the Products doc now.
        - [x] Removed the empty project doc folders.
        - [x] Look at Circular Language Spec Strategy for things to put in Circular Language Spec Products.
        - [x] Look at Circular Language Spec Project Steps & Time Planning for things to put in Circular Language Spec Products.
            - [x] There is a lot there that specifies the reasons to change the articles.
        - [x] Consider that some elaborations in the Circular Language Spec Products document might belong elsewhere.
            - [x] Do they belong in Circular Language Spec Strategy?
            - [x] Sort of collides with the Sub-Project folders idea. Maybe details belong in a sub-project folder and a general reference to it in the strategy doc.
            - [x] Maybe go the other way: put sub-projects strategy in the main strategy doc and get rid of separate sub-projects. (My gut says: no, keep sub-project descriptions. That's what they are for: elaboration on a sub-project's scope.)
            - [x] Decision: Rule: Any elaboration now in the Products planning doc, belongs in a sub-project document.
- [x] Sub-Projects:
    - [x] The documents could probably be shorter. Lots of those Project Summaries are not so useful template texts, not filled in. The notes at the bottom might do.
    - [x] Then it is basically just loose ideas, that might have been given a too prominent place. Maybe put it elsewhere, if it is just unhelpful for visual overview, perhaps. > Some are more than that. I keep em this way.
- [x] I like that I seem to build tolerance (back) for not exactly knowing where I am going with it, gradually shaping it, and just taking my time to make things more overviewable, regardless of whether someone might think it is time well spent or not. I myself just create more overview and understanding of the material that way.
