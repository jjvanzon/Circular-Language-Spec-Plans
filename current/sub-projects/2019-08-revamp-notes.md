Circular Language Spec 
======================

Revamp | 2019-08 | Notes
------------------------

### Introduction

This project *Circular Language Spec | Revamp* might be an umbrella-project about multiple topics. The main point may be to change the *form* of the Circular Language Spec documents:

- Scoping more sharply
- Converting to web-friendly format
- Publishing
- Changing tone
 
When changing a topic's *tone*, perhaps *content changes* might be addressed too.  
There might be separate sub-project documents about specific topics.
