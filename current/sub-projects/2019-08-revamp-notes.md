### Introduction

This project *Circular Language Spec | Revamp* is an umbrella-project about multiple topics. The main point may be to change the *form* of the Circular Language Spec documents:

- [x] Scoping more sharply
- [x] Converting to web-friendly format
- [x] Publishing

When changing a topic's *tone*, perhaps *content changes* might be addressed too.  
There might be separate sub-project documents about specific topics.
