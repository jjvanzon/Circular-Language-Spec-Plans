### TODO

#### 2022-02-02 TODO Classes Article Content Changes

- [x] Might be made shorter.
- [x] Same notation explained from different contextual angles might be a bit overdone.
- [x] "Using Dashed Shapes", "Using an Object as a Class" and "Shape Both Dashed and Solid" seem to be going on about similar notation ideas, which could be merged.
- [x] "Shape Both Dashed and Solid": 
    - [x] Might remove that concept.
    - [x] Saying something like this, might be adequate: "A shape could be drawn with a dashed border if it is used as a class."
    - [x] Then referencing a class like an object could be introduced as a side-issue.
- [x] Moving "Defining its own Class" to Construct Drafts (edge case, details).
- [x] More labels like "Object" and "Class" in pictures? Perhaps not all pictures, but ones introducing the concept perhaps yes.
- [x] Some sentences say something similar. Might shorten it.
- [x] Making changed parts a different color in image showing data changes.
- [x] Object Reference with a Class: Maybe adding a situation that is *not* valid might be helpful.
    - [x] Might look at article Type Control / Type Safety, Genericity, Explicit for inspiration.
- [x] More shape labels in pictures. (Used Font "Ink Free".)
- [x] Adding the meaning of the line dissector for direction to the Basic Notation section.
- [x] Rewording.
- [ ] Adding a banner at the top.

### Postponed

- [ ] ~ Classes articles might need an update considering that the notation(s) for static might change things.

### Done

#### 2020-06-11 Done Content Changes for Classes Chapter

- [x] Object-commands / command-objects exchangeability doubts.
- [x] It seems to be used as the main idea, this exchangeability. But that seems demotable to Circular Broader View perhaps or maybe even Circular Construct Drafts.
- [x] What might be left of the Classes story if the base of it might be deprecated? Almost a rewrite? Not sure.
- [x] What if I move the exchangeability issue to Circular Broader View or Circular Construct Drafts? Might not much text be left?
- [x] ~~Is there a version in the history that might not make the Object-commands / command-objects exchangeability issue centric? Could that text be used?~~
- [x] Some of the text seems to address the design time = run time issues. That issue might also not be in scope anymore.
- [x] I feel the same sentence is repeated a lot in just slightly different formulations.
- [x] Class Reference seems a bit of an ambiguous term. You might reference a class with an object line, but here I mean when an object points out its class with a class line. Class redirection? Class pointer? I think I might rather make pointer and reference synonymous, so maybe not class pointer.
- [x] The diagram explanation of Commands and Classes Loosely Coupled might be merged into the conceptual explanation, if I follow the editing ideas I had. But the issue might be moved from Circular Language Spec to Circular Broader View at some point, so perhaps this has less priority. Not sure. I could go either way.
