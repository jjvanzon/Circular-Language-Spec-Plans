#### 2020-07-24 Postponed Checklist Reformulating Commands Main Concepts Article

- [x] Fine-tune styling.
- [ ] ~ Evaluating if texts are in scope, possibly moving them.
    - [ ] ~ But most sections seem appropriate and in-scope to me, except maybe the bottom edge-cases, but I think I might get to that in time eventually.
    - [ ] ~ Commands Anywhere has a Broader View feel to it according to my opinion.
    - [ ] ~ Terms "In" and "Out" might be avoided.
        - [ ] ~ I seemed to be juggling the concepts Get and Set on one hand and In and Out on the other, before realizing they might not be synonymous.
        - [ ] ~ I seem to go into specifics about Input/Output. I might want to move those specifics out at one point. I think I might like to evaluate that as I sequentially go through the text.
        - [ ] ~ I might actually move the section where those terms are used: move them from the Commands chapter to the Parameters chapter.
        - [ ] ~ Perhaps later be honest in the Parameters article about this paradox. Other people may also feel uneasy about it and it makes it maybe more understandable why the terms are avoided.
- [ ] ~ Marking trigger words in red.
    - [x] With find and replace
    - [x] Manually
    - [ ] ~ Over-used words?
        - [x] "The"?
- [ ] ~ Finding replacement words, possibly using online thesaurus.
    - [ ] ~ Going through text sequentially.
    - [ ] ~ Sometimes moving things to an 'Out of Scope' section.
    - [ ] ~ Terms "In" and "Out" might be avoided.
        - [ ] ~ Because it seems ambiguous (for instance an object reference (__'Object In__' parameter?) can be considered both input and output at the same time.)
        - [ ] ~ Replacement terms might be ones such as __Get Object__ Parameter or __Set Value__ Parameter. It may not look as pretty, but it might help me avoid the paradox that I experience if I were to call them __In__ and __Out__.
- [ ] ~ Put subjectivity in perspective.
- [ ] ~ Change the orange markings (pictures, texts to move or change).
- [ ] ~ Pictures:
    - [ ] ~ Maybe draw new ones in one go, on paper and then scan it.
    - [ ] ~ Sometimes borrow (pieces of) other pictures
    - [ ] ~ Or simplify pictures by editing them.
- [ ] ~ Merge conceptual/diagram explanations:
    - [ ] ~ When I reformulate things top to bottom, I might at one point feel that the merging of conceptual explanation and diagram explanation is actually finished, because right now, often they are put near each other, but not really became one merged text.
- [ ] ~ I have difficulty not wanting to change the story, while the aim is to just reword it, and I seem to experience an impossibility not absorbing the story. My conundrum might be solved, by adding indicators that everything is just a suggestion, so that no idea might disrupt anything, even when I may not entirely agree with it myself. Sometimes I might do the changes anyway.
- [ ] ~ Going over the document again to reformulate.
- [ ] ~ I might go over the loose ideas in the document and cross out or distribute those.
- [ ] ~ Spell check.
