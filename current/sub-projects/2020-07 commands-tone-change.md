- [x] Marking trigger words in red.
    - [x] With find and replace
    - [x] Manually

My conundrum might be solved, by adding indicators that everything is just a suggestion, so that no idea might disrupt anything, even when I may not entirely agree with it myself. Sometimes I might do the changes anyway.
- [ ] ~ Going over the document again to reformulate.
- [ ] ~ I might go over the loose ideas in the document and cross out or distribute those.
- [ ] ~ Spell check.
