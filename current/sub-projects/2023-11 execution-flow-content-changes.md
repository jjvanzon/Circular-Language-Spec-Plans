Execution Flow | Content Changes

- [ ] ~ Maybe only merge conceptual explanation with diagram notation explanation.
- [ ] ~ The split up into a conceptual explanation and then separately an article for the diagram notation, might have been easy for writing the docs, but could be merged into a single article again for readability.

#### 2020-05-20 Postponed Content Changes for Execution Control

- [ ] ~ Execution Control sort of seems an application of Circular Language rather than an intrinsic part. Arithmetic and other operators were supposed to be something like that too: an application of Circular diagrams. I wonder why I explain execution control in detail, while for math operations I leave that out. Maybe an article about that might make things clearer/complete/make you not wonder where all the operators have gone in this language.
- [ ] ~ I saw 'execution flow' somewhere. I want to consider using that term instead of execution control. I just like the word flow. It makes me feel better than 'control'. But maybe it might somehow not work in sentences. Not sure. Maybe execution flow can mean the normal flow, while execution 'control' can actually change the flow. Still maybe flow as a general term feel nicer.
