### Rough Plan

- [ ] .. Milder tone
- [ ] .. More open, less resolute language
- [ ] .. Use common IT terms
- [ ] .. Less resolute language, more wiggle room
- [ ] .. (Perhaps search for definites such as 'have to', 'must', 'would', 'should', 'very'.)
- [ ] .. (Maybe I am being quite strict towards myself, about rewriting things in a milder tone.)

### Information

    - Thesaurus: <https://www.thesaurus.com/>
    - Google Translate: <https://translate.google.com/>
- Polite forms in English Language: https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/politeness_2

####  Wiggle Word Method Checklist

- [ ] Wiggle words:
    - [ ] (More helpers are in my personal development notes, not here, sorry.)
    - [ ] Marking trigger words in red.
    - [ ] Possibly mark questionable trigger words with a star (*) too.
    - [ ] Finding replacement words, possibly using online thesaurus.
- [ ] Word variation:
    - [ ] Replacing some "may" and "might" occurrences with other words that introduce wiggle room.
- [ ] Directness:
    - [ ] Removing "might" and "may" where adequate wiggle room may already be present.
    - [ ] Replacing indefinites back some with definites, for readability. 
    - [ ] Reading over text again to reformulate for readability.
    - [ ] Appropriateness:
        - [ ] Definite language for comment on diagrams and syntax.
        - [ ] Less definite language for philosophical opinion.
        - [ ] Less definite language where ideas are iffy.
        - [ ] Put subjectivity in perspective.
- [ ] Word variation:
    - [ ] Alternating evenly between words "may" and "might".
- [ ] Reading over and rewording until satisfied.

### TODO

#### 2021-04-13 Postponed Milder Tone in Bulk

- [ ] ~ Perhaps changing *all* the documents at the same time, *one* trigger word at a time, might better fit my way of processing things.
- [x] 🐇 Replacing "will" with "might".
- [x] 🍦 Replacing "must" with "might" or "may".
- [x] 🍰 Replacing "would" with "might".
- [x] 🎵 Replacing "does" with "might".
- [x] 🎵 Correcting back: "probably might"
- [x] 🍪 Replacing "have to" with "might".
    - [x] ↩ Correcting replacements "'d have to" => "'d might"
    - [x] ↩ Correcting replacements "do not have to" => "do not might"
    - [x] ↩ Correcting replacements "don' have to" => "don't might"
    - [x] ↩ Correcting replacements "have to do with " => "might do with"
    - [x] ↩ Correcting replacements "might have to" => "might might"
    - [x] ↩ Correcting replacements "might just have to" => "might just might"
    - [x] ↩ Correcting replacements "might not have to " => "might not might"
    - [x] ↩ Correcting replacements "to have to" => "to might"
- [x] Search for "have to" again.
- [x] "visual studio code" find in files results missing.
    - [x] Seems more buggy when doing Ctrl-Shift-F, paste text.
    - [x] Seems less buggy when clicking on the magnifier and typing text.
- [x] 🧾 Correcting "t might" occurrences
    - [x] "Don't might", "won't might", etc.
    - [x] Replaced by "might not" in most cases.
- [ ] Searching for "can", replacing some occurrences.
- [ ] Searching for "should", replacing some occurrences.

### Postponed

#### 2020-04-18 Postponed Brainstorm Writing Style

- [ ] ~ The aim is to use less definite, more open language.
- [ ] ~ (I can view ideas on how in my personal development notes, not here, sorry.)
- [ ] ~ Also check: whether the stories make sense.
- [ ] ~ And whether the content is still in scope.
- [ ] ~ Remove links, since they break so easily.
- [ ] ~ Casual mentionings of article titles are also fragile. They break quite easily.
- [ ] ~ That seems quite a lot to check. Maybe that is why it is not easy.

#### 2020-05-27 Postponed Checklist Reformulating Chapters

- [x] Done projects:
    - [x] The postponed reformulation of the done projects is on my mind.
- [x] New Intro:
    - [x] But that makes me think: I want to give it a new beginning in the first place: use some of the old Symbol Language documentation and reformulate a gentler intro.
- [ ] ~ Reformulating:
    - [ ] ~ More open, less resolute language
    - [ ] ~ I could start reading and reformulating top to bottom.
    - [x] ~ Introduction: Applying trigger word marking technique to this already reworded document?
    - [ ] ~ For topics TODO / Done: See *Circular Language Spec Product List*.

#### 2019-08-05 Postponed Mixed Writing Style Issues

- [ ] ~ The read uses terminology in a very specific way, that is not shared with my peers, therefor not easing readers into the material.
- [ ] ~ Rename the term 'Code Base' to something like 'Base Code' or 'Base of the Code'.
- [ ] ~ I seem to have had several goals fighting over each other, in projects done long ago about this documentation:
    - [ ] ~ Explaining it to myself.
    - [ ] ~ Designing the concepts, separately from the notation.
    - [ ] ~ Tying together loose ends.
    - [ ] ~ Making it easy to read for someone else.

#### 2019-08-27 Postponed Simpler Rules

- [ ] ~ I think the 'being blunt' might help. It is not blunt unfriendly, because the explanations might become so much simpler if you say: this is that, this is that, instead of and this far-fetched edge case is solved in this difficult, abstract, theoretical, but precisely determined way, that I'm not sure I even understand anymore... : )

### Done

#### 2020-06-18 Done Brainstorm Reconsidering Writing Style

I seem to not like it when I make the rules for reformulating things so strict. It is sort of paradoxical too. The text produced is supposed to be not as strict, but the rule for making the text not strict, is strict.

It was supposed to feel like hobby.

I think I might like to change the rules by which I was reformulating these texts.  
I think I want to be more ok with words that seem to exaggerate or be quite strong. For instance "distinct", ''rule", "defined". Maybe I want to keep those words in there.  
I think I am noticing that many words just are black and white. If I use a thesaurus I get to see words that might also be quite strong.  
Maybe I can leave it with adding maybe's and perhapses and leave words that seem to express it strongly, in there.

Reasons for changing the way to do it might be:

- It seems to make me anxious being hyper aware of these 'forbidden' words.
- The text seems to now lack flair, and might not grab attention as well anymore.
- I feel I use more in between words, that carry not much meaning. It seems wordier than necessary.

I used to aim to be concise. In doing so, some thing might start to seem a bit commanding or something. But I did do my best then to make the text clear. Maybe this is not such a bad thing and maybe I was not doing that badly at it after all. Maybe just adding some wiggle words is enough, so that I might form an intermediate writing style. Perhaps that might be concise, strong, but leaving room for other options.

I might like to feel comfortable writing again. I might like to not do it 'wrong' like before, if that was even wrong.

#### 2020-05-31 Done Wiggle Word Difficulty

- [x] A less pleasant experience yesterday with the trigger word marking.
- [x] Still the problem that formulations not necessarily come naturally to me.
- [x] I liked describing a system of trigger words.
- [x] I also kind of liked picking them out, marking them red.
- [x] But trying to find alternate formulations for them, was tricky.
- [x] One thing that seems to bother me, is that I do not see that a rule is too fixated, until I have formulated it in a more open sense and sensed that it is feels closer to the truth. But I do not seem to read a resolute sentence and realize it could use wiggle room. I mostly just see a valid rule, not one too harshly stated.
- [x] Another aspect to consider is that formulating new sentences quite automatically I insert the wiggle words, probably because I did train myself a bit to use them more. But seeing the problem in existing texts is harder somehow.
- [x] I might like that after marking trigger words in red, it might be a matter of arbitrarily inserting wiggle words, removing adjectives or changing definite verbs to more polite ones.
- [x] But I end up scratching my head trying to find a way to reformulate something. Difficulty to find the 'nicest' alternate word, or sometimes even to realize something is even wrong with the trigger word I marked in red.
- [x] Sometimes my brain says: nothing is wrong with trigger word, but when I replaced it with difficulty, I realize the trigger word did seemed to be 'wrong' after all, and realize that things are not necessarily that black and white.
- [x] But my mind, that is reading and understanding these existing sentences might not sense anything wrong with them really, so has difficulty finding a proper way to change it, or even a reason. It's it like my mind resists changing the sentence, because at first I fail to see why.
- [x] An additional problem seems to be that I have very little energy. This computer hobby usually takes little energy. I am built that way. But certain things about it do take energy. This task seems to tap into something my mind might not automatically do naturally or easily. Not sure why. It just takes too much effort.
- [x] I kept re-evaluating the sentence as rewritten: whether it 'walked' well, whether it still made sense, whether the wording is varied enough in the document as a whole. That might be a lot of language processing for me right now.
- [x] So after this reflection I am left with a question: How to proceed?
- [x] Alternative: I am not sure, but could I proceed the same way, and just hope I might have more energy now?
- [x] Alternative: It may need focus to try and insert wiggle words sort of 'robotically', maybe not even looking at the meaning of the sentences.
- [x] > One alternative seems to need energy. The other altenative seems to need focus. Neither is aplenty.
- [x] Alternative: Build up more wiggle word dictionary. May be hard, because thinking of alternate words seems energy draining.
- [x] Limitation: That the document I work on now goes from one topic to the next, might not help me.
- [x] Limitation: Switching between the chapter content and the overview content is probably difficult switching for me.
- [x] Limitation: Doing it in a way to avoid where my problems are, requires focus, which seems to be a problem in itself.
- [x] Limitation: I think maybe language processing is problematic for me right now.
- [x] Alternative: Using the existing wiggle word dictionary, inserting wiggle words robotically. No careful evaluation.
- [x] I do estimate that the above should be the kind of thing I used to be good at. But focus was the problem yesterday. Could not hold myself to a plan anymore yesterday, I guess. Maybe I can today.
- [x] Helper: Putting up a Post It: "Insert wiggle words robotically", for focus.
- [x] Helper: Keeping the wiggle room dictionary closed? (prevent switching)
- [x] Helper: Use thesaurus.com for words.
- [x] One problem I see with 'insert wiggle words robotically', is that inserting wiggle words was not my only goal editing this documentation. Maybe I can make wiggle words one phase and reformulation a second phase, and not do it in one blow, because it seems to make it more difficult. I just do not want to forget that I also want to make the text better content-wise, not just change the tone.
- [x] While doing it:
    - [x] Accept limited word variation at first?
    - [x] Yes, when I cannot find a word, it is hard on me.
    - [x] Sometimes a text might be deprecated. Saves some reformulation, but may personally mean more information processing > more easily tired.

#### 2020-04-18 Done Brainstorm Writing Style

- [x] ~~It kind of bothers me that the story starts in the middle. Where are the other sub-project descriptions? Maybe mixed with other big projects, like 'Software System Documentation'. Maybe.~~
- [x] Brainstorm: I worry a lot if the words come off too strongly. On top of that I am not in a very subtle mood right now. If I was feeling more calm and friendly, I might have better judgement about it. Maybe I cannot do this right now. I can only judge language constructions, not whether it feels right. When my base line mood might be calm and friendly, I can just feel whether the words bump with that or not. That might be easier. Sometimes just using calmer language, makes me calmer, but right now it does not seem to be working.
- [x] Wording:
    - [x] Is it really such a problem, that I talk in definites about steps taken and rules of the systematics as I try to work them out? Maybe in talk like that, still add a 'might'. Imagine what if you might not explain to yourself, but to someone else that has to work it out further. Imagine what it might feel like if someone else read it. Like you're being dictated rules, perhaps.
    - [x] After that I might want to change command-like sentences and rule-like statements, to just add 'might' to it or other wiggle words. I might talk to myself that way, just maybe comes off harsh. Maybe being less strict towards myself is also not a bad idea.
    - [x] Added maybe's.
    - [x] Perhaps after that a reformulation phase. I tend to come up with nicer flowing alternatives to just the word 'maybe'.
- [x] Brainstorm wording:
    - [x] Maybe I go a different direction with this.
    - [x] With my gut I might assess whether the language is too blunt or not.
    - [x] Maybe if it just list things, that actually happened, then it might not be much of a problem.
    - [x] Definite language to create a pseudo-truth for a false sense of control, might be a problem.
    - [x] Things stated as rules, that are not hard rules might be a problem.
    - [x] When setting rules to follow a plan, wiggle words might be helpful.
    - [x] Black and white opinion about something that may or may not be true, might be a problem.
    - [x] In some sentences it seems more obvious. If they sound opinionated and black-and-white.
    - [x] Maybe I am looking for clues in texts where there are none. Sort of like when I am driving and see no other traffic, I am scared that there may be traffic, that I am not seeing.
    - [x] Words like 'annoying' or 'constantly' trigger more easily. Stating something as definite, without 'maybe's seems a more subtle 'problem'.

#### 2008-08-31 Done Writing Style Ideas

Circular Language Spec, Writing Style,  
2008-08-31

Sometimes it is just clearer to have an article, with diagrams in it straight away, without any article with just textual explanations. In the future, the whole form of the documentation might change as such and have diagram expression be more present in the conceptual explanations.
