### Introduction

This document tries to list the things that might be produced in the project *Circular Language Spec*.

You may find a lack of explanations here. If there were an explanation of a topic, you might be able to find it in the actual *Circular Language Spec* documentation or in a document in the *Sub-Projects* folder perhaps. There might simply *be* no explanation text yet and it may be an aim of the sub-project to produce that.

### TODO

#### General Things

These topics may be about general restructurings of the works.

- [ ] Planning | in General (ongoing)
- [ ] Content Reorganization (ongoing)
- [ ] ~ Might still including hour sheet  
        (Extracting it from hour sheet about multiple projects.)

#### Tone Change

There may be a desire to change the tone of the documentation to milder language. Details might be found in sub-project documentation.

Done articles may benefit from a redo, balancing between indirect language and direct language for readability and added word variation.

#### Content Changes

These topics might already be in the spec, but specific changes might be desired. Those desired changes, may be found in sub-project descriptions.

One possible task may be correcting for new insight / decisions. For instance, the *assignment* notation may have undergone a few changes and the other documentation may not have been adapted to that yet.

Content changes may also be addressed while changing the *tone* of a document. Sometimes it may seem redundant work, to change the wording of text that seems mostly deprecated, so content changes may sometimes happen before tone change.

#### Constructs Unfinished

These are constructs that might be desired and may hardly have a description in the spec yet.

- [ ] Object Resolution | Language Design

#### Language Design

These topics may be more significant changes to how the language might be described. Some are extensions that may be optional for now.

- [ ] Fully OO. Is It? | Language Design
    - [ ] Operators | Language Design
        - [ ] Arithmetic, comparative, logical, bit, string
    - [ ] Modifiers | Language Design
    - [ ] Textual Fallback | Language Design
    - [ ] Basic Types | Language Design
        - [ ] Strings, numbers...
    - [ ] Enums | Language Design
    - [ ] Structs | Language Design
    - [ ] Union Types | Language Design
    - [ ] ...
<br/><br/>
- [ ] Access Marks Redo | Language Design
    - [ ] (Make them arrows by default? Think of something different for protected? Reconsider all 'marks' on lines, like Conditions and special access modifiers?)
- [ ] Large Lists Problem | Language Design
<br/><br/>
- [ ] Pointers Separate Chapter | Language Design
- [ ] More Pictures | Language Design
<br/><br/>
