### Done

#### 2020-06-26 Done Reformulating System Objects Article

- [x] Fine-tune styling.
- [x] Evaluating if texts are in scope, possibly moving them.
- [x] Marking trigger words in red.
    - [x] With find and replace
    - [x] Manually
    - [x] Over-used words? "The", "related"?
- [x] Finding replacement words, possibly using online thesaurus.
    - [x] "Relation" => "Relationship"?
- [x] Put subjectivity in perspective.
- [x] Change the orange markings (pictures, texts to move).
    - [x] Maybe I forgot to merge the conceptual description with diagram demonstration.
- [x] More over-used words / trigger words?
    - [x] "The"
    - [x] "Full"
        - [x] I still might be stating half-truths where I use trigger words. I do not seem to notice it at first. I just said 'full system interface' but later I introduce more members, so is the word 'full' appropriate? This raises insecurity with me. I often do not even seem to see it happen.
- [x] Going over the document again to reformulate.
    - [x] Temporarily taken out:
        - [x] It could be used by other system objects to wrap an object reference into context.
        - [x] A reference may come into play when objects relate to each other.
    - [x] I have difficulty processing the info/reading.
- [x] Pictures:
    - [x] "System Interface for the Class Aspect"
        - [x] Not many pictures here.
        - [x] Each sentence might call for the question: how would that look in a diagram? Some of it might not even be clear to me. I might want to consider one by one.
    - [x] Maybe draw new ones in one go, on paper and then scan it.
    - [x] Sometimes borrow (pieces of) other pictures
    - [x] Or simplify pictures by editing them.
- [x] Merge conceptual/diagram explanations:
    - [x] When I reformulate things top to bottom, I might at one point feel that the merging of conceptual explanation and diagram explanation is actually finished, because right now, often they are put near each other, but not really became one merged text.
    - [x] More prominently the possible merging of System Commands and System Interface sections.
    - [x] (I wonder if System Commands and System Interfaces could become 1 section, because is the System Interfaces section(s) the visualization of the System Commands? I tend to not like conceptual explanations without accompanying diagrams anymore, so perhaps.)
- [x] I have difficulty not wanting to change the story, while the aim is to just reword it, and I seem to experience an impossibility not absorbing the story. My conundrum might be solved, by adding indicators that everything is just a suggestion, so that no idea would disrupt anything, even when I may not entirely agree with it myself.
